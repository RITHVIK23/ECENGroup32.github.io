# FashionMNSIT Classification using Machine Learning and Deep learning algorithms

Abstractâ€” This research paper delves into the utilization of sophisticated machine learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), for the classification of the FashionMNIST dataset. FashionMNIST, a widely recognized benchmark dataset in the realm of computer vision, comprises 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each associated with one of the ten fashion categories. The primary aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of CNN and KNN algorithms in accurately categorizing these diverse fashion items. 

The CNN model is intricately designed to extract hierarchical features from the images by incorporating multiple convolutional and pooling layers. The neural network undergoes training on the provided dataset through stochastic gradient descent with backpropagation. Subsequently, its performance is rigorously evaluated on the testing dataset. Additionally, the KNN algorithm, renowned for its simplicity and effectiveness in image classification tasks, is applied to the dataset.

The experimental outcomes shed light on the comparative strengths and weaknesses of both CNN and KNN methodologies within the context of FashionMNIST classification. Performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, are employed to comprehensively assess the models' classification capabilities. The research findings contribute significantly to discerning the suitability of these algorithms for image classification tasks, offering valuable insights into their potential applications within the clothing domain.
